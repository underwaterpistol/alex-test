## Description

When i try to wash my back, i can never quite reach the middle. This means i need to use third party resources to keep my back clean.

## Expected behaviour

I should be able to reach the middle of my own back.

## Steps taken

* Tried to use a loofah on a stick, but it bonks me on the head - unsafe.
